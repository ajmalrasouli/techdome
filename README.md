## Front-end resources

The front-end is a static site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's static and has a visitor counter. The visitor counter data fetched via an API call to an Azure Function.

## Back-end resources

The back-end is an [HTTP triggered](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=csharp) Azure Functions with Cosmos DB input and output binding. The Function is triggered, it retrieves the CosmosDB item, add +1 to it, and saves it and returns its value to the caller.

## CI/CD Resources

- This is how you can deploy a blob storage static site with [GitHub actions.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-static-site-github-actions) Used in frontend.main.yml.


## Visitor Counter Badge (Free!)
Powered by Microsoft Azure

Visitor Counter Badge is a simple open-source utility you can use to display the number of visitors on a web page, repository, or profile. Every request to render the visitor count badge invokes an HTTP-triggered Azure function that dynamically generates an SVG image that you can apply on a web page, profile page, or repository. 

If you are further interested in learning the internals of this service, please read the Visitor Counter Badge article by Rahul Rai on
